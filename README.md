# GeneticAlgorithm
 
 
Introduction
Genetic algorithms provide probabilistic solutions to optimization problems. These algorithms can be thought of as an advanced “guess and check” technique that eventually arrives at an output that is close to the actual solution without having to know how to compute the solution directly.

I have written a generic genetic algorithm that can find approximate solutions to optimization problems. This algorithm is written in such a way that it can be reused for any application suitable for a genetic algorithm. 

Important:

Immutable
Designed and implemented a genetic algorithm without using any mutable variables or state.
